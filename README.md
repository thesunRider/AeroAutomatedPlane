# Aero Automated Plane
 An ambitious *SAE  micro class* project of _CLUB AEROUNWIRED_,NITC.
## Description
  __SAE__ is an yearly aircraft designing challenge conducted for students.
   Club Aerounwired is making an in-house _autonomous system_ for monitoring a micro class aircraft using _arduino_ and _raspberry pi_. The system will stream all relevant data (parameters),such as __*speed, altitude*__ etc. from the aircraft to a remote pc/laptop through  which we can monitor the flight.
